# Introduction #

I like to work with Lego Digital Designer but finding of parts is very limited. Because of this i wrote myself a little tool wich make working with LDD  better. Because the tool is better working than expected i want to share the beta version already with you all. If anyone found a bug or a feature request, let me know.

# Begin of a FAQ #

for LDD Direct to function following LDD state/theme is required :

  * if you want to copy a designID direct to LDD, the LDD program should be in LDD Extended mode/theme.

  * if you want to copy a itemnos (official colored part with number) the LDD program should be in LDD mode/theme.

You can change the LDD mode/theme at all time in the LDD View menu - New themes.
